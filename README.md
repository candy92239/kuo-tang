### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
npm run serve

Hi me: DO NO, I repeat, DO NO try to psuh using VSC source contorl. It'll ruin you. Use bash.
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
npm run deploy

To me: you'll need to enter psw for this, if not, something's wrong
When pushing, ditch gitHooks in package.json if it takes forever to lint
```
